The given flexibility and room shall support the OSH bodies to act responsible, to be motivated and innovative.<br />There is a fixed structure of the bodies consisting of the Occupational Safety and Health Advisory Board (Arbeitnehmerschutzbeirat ASB), national coordinators, the Strategic Platform, the Network of Labour Inspectorates with regional coordinators and the evaluation team.<br />They follow the <a href="http://www.arbeitsinspektion.gv.at/cms/inspektorat/download.html?channel=CH3631&amp;doc=CMS1450104956999&amp;permalink=oeas_gemeinsame-resolution" target="_blank"> Resolution </a>, laid down by the Federal Minister of Labour, Social Affairs and Consumer Protection, other relevant ministries, social partners, accident insurances and other institutions relevant for OSH issues. <br />The objectives are proposed by the OSH bodies on the basis of the joint resolution and approved by the Occupational Safety and Health Advisory Board. If necessary, the fields of work of the working groups have to be adapted to the Resolution.<br />In the current strategy document three objectives were set:</p><ul><li>The reduction of work-related health risks, particularly strains on the musculoskeletal system and mental stress factors and the reduction of accidents at work</li><li>The improvement of risk assessment and support via preventive specialists</li><li>The strengthening of awareness and improvements in the initial and further education and training (both at school and in universities) for occupational safety and health.</li></ul>
